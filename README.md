# instrument-stellantis-director

Production-pipeline agent for the Stellantis Tier 2 Retail AOR pitch. A tagged
script and a dial config go in; for each scene ("cell") the agent assembles a
Brand Gravity request, resolves brand-knowledge slices, runs one Claude director
call, and emits a typed **cell-output envelope** (TwelveLabs queries, CG/AI
environment prompts, Substance rows, super text) to a draft store for human
approval.

Demo: the `MAP_Retail_Ram_Test :15 South` script, run through `great_lakes`, then
`southwest`, watching the scene-by-lane matrix fill.

---

## Architecture

```
POST /run {script, dials, styling_inputs, lane, season}
   └─ pipeline.runner: walk scenes in order (sequential, so the room watches the matrix fill)
        ├─ cell_specs[cell_type] → which BG buckets to request + which output types are allowed
        ├─ BGClient.resolve(request)        # fixture provider (deepest-scope-wins) + per-run cache
        ├─ director.run(slices, dials, styling, prior_cell_resolved)
        │     └─ Claude (claude-opus-4-8), forced tool-use → schema-valid envelope, confidence-tagged
        ├─ validation.check_envelope(...)   # brand-rule invariants → review flags
        ├─ outputs.substance_excel          # substance_row drops into the exact demo xlsx
        └─ DraftStore.put(envelope)         # status by confidence: high=auto-accept, med=needs-approve, low=blocked
GET /drafts · GET /drafts/{id} · POST /drafts/{id}/approve
```

Each cell receives the prior cell's resolved envelope as `prior_cell_resolved`
(continuity). The four dials (`styling_carry_over`, `regional_specificity`,
`voice_adherence`, `narrative_continuity`) and the spot-level styling inputs flow
into the director's system prompt.

The four cell types (the script writer tags each scene; the agent inherits, never
decides): `regionalized_running_w_cgi_ai`, `stock`, `existing_running_footage`,
`regionalized_ai_scenes` (the only one that emits a Substance row).

## Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
cp .env.example .env        # then set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

Key env vars (see `.env.example`): `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `DIRECTOR_MODEL`
(default `claude-opus-4-8`), `BG_MODE` (`fixture` | `http`), `DRAFT_STORE_PATH`,
`SUBSTANCE_OUT_PATH`.

## Run the demo

```bash
python scripts/run_demo.py          # South:15 through great_lakes then southwest; prints the matrix
```

## Run the service

```bash
uvicorn director_agent.api.app:app --reload
# POST /run with {script, lane, dials?, styling, season}
```

## Tests

```bash
pytest                              # schema, fixtures, substance xlsx, runner, director plumbing, invariants
```

The director-plumbing and runner tests use a fake Anthropic client, so the suite
runs fully offline (no API key needed). Only `run_demo.py` makes live calls.

## Brand Gravity is a live service — not built here

Brand Gravity is a live, consumer-grade data application (admin GUI at
`bg-admin.donercolle.dev`, retrieval endpoint `/v1/context`). This repo is a
**consumer** of it, not a reimplementation. The agent talks to BG through one
`BGClient` interface with two providers:

- **`fixture`** (default) — serves slices from `data/bg_fixtures/`, authored from
  `BrandGravity_RAM_Store_Compilation_2026-06-08.md`. The RAM buckets are not yet
  connected to live BG, so fixtures stand in for the pitch.
- **`http`** — posts the structured request to `/v1/context` and parses the
  documented response. A thin, interface-complete stub today; flip `BG_MODE=http`
  and supply `BG_BASE_URL` / `BG_API_KEY` when the RAM buckets come online. No
  agent code changes.

Both satisfy the same contract; the director cannot tell which path produced a
response. Slices carry `notes_for_consumers` addressing the director directly —
the director composes by following those notes, not by interpreting raw content.

### Reconciliation of the spec (§4 / §9 deltas)

The cell-contracts spec (`_ref/BrandGravity_CellContracts_DirectorSpec_2026-06-08.md`)
predates this build. Two clarifications it should reflect:

- **§4** documents the BG request/response *contract* (which this repo implements
  on the agent side). It is **not** a build spec for Brand Gravity — BG already
  exists. Treated here as the client contract only.
- **§9** "Repo scaffold" is realized as this single service. There is no Brand
  Gravity to build; the only BG-side artifact is the fixture data that proxies the
  live store until the RAM buckets connect.

The dated `_ref` spec is left unmodified as the source artifact; this section is
the authoritative reconciliation.

## Not in scope

Brand Gravity itself; Shawn's real draft system (local store stands in behind the
`DraftStore` adapter); TwelveLabs / Substance / Runway / Odd integrations;
local-tagging-to-77-markets; the social-intelligence agent. All are
downstream/external per the architecture diagram.
